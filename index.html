        <h1>Situationships101</h1>
        <p>So you're just a 21st century girl trying to live her best life. 
           You meet a 21st century guy and you guys are kicking it, vibing,
           getting down and dirty together, basically doing all the stuff people
           do in a relationship. But wait a minute! He never really did ask you out did he??
           Well, you my dear are in what we call a <strong><em>Situationship</em></strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>So What Exactly is a Situationship?</h2>
        <p>
            Well according to urban dictionary(which by the way is every 21st century girls go to dictionary),
            one of and personally my favourite description on there of what it really is;
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>When one or two motherfuckers take part in a relationship, but out of fear of making things serious or messy, do not label it, leading to said relationship, ironically, becoming more serious and messier.
                A Situationship is emotional trauma in a gift box.</em>
